## Off The Record (A World Without Records)

Tyler woke up on the afternoon of June thirteenth, twenty nineteen, to find nothing particularly remarkable was happening. He had an evening shift from five to nine, briefly noting he was gonna need more hours if he had any shot of affording his tuition given how much of his money earned at work is also spent there. After getting dressed and preparing his breakfast Tyler returned to his room and sat down at his desk, opened his laptop, and began his summer morning ritual of scrolling through Reddit, he had long since unfollowed any subreddits pertaining to news, he thought the only thing worse than hearing the news was hearing peoples opinions about it. Instead, he spent his morning looking at various posts various members of the retro music community had made, he noted someone from the Audiophile subreddit had purchased the new Marantz CD84. At this Tyler briefly glanced over to his shelf of various Cassette tapes and the Teac W-1600 that sat beneath, remembering exactly why it was he had to go to work in just a few hours.
As the afternoon moved on Tyler gathered his things, put on his uniform, and sat down in the driver's seat of his car, he opened his glove compartment, taking out and opening a case which he just sort of stared at until a particular album jumped out at him. Placing in the tape and beginning to pull out of his driveway as the carefully kept album played from the top. Tyler briefly thought to himself how it was only the large corporate bands as well as the indie bands who had the right demographic, that could actually afford to branch out into the more fringe retro styles like these, but nowadays basically every musical group with even a bit of a following was sending out cassette tapes. As a Canadian, it was damn near impossible to a good selection of 8-Track tapes from within the country, one of his worst nightmares was the idea of someone breaking into his car and stealing the tapes he had to pay a pretty penny to import, however, he also considered even at his work he was considered a bit of a weirdo as a result of his affection for the format. He hadn’t been able to find a car with the capabilities to play the tapes, luckily such a car would be rare even in The States where his imports came from, meaning he had a pretty easy time finding and ordering an adapter online. 
About twenty minutes later he pulled into the driveway of the mall at which he worked, grabbing his backpack and walking inside. It was unsurprisingly pretty busy given the time of the year and of his shift. He walked into work and briefly gazed at the lines of various tapes resisting the urge to make a pre-shift purchase. Passing by the single CD aisle that the store contained he briefly wondered just how close history was to having a world of CD enthusiasts, after all the devices were only about a decade off if you consider the release of the Compact Cassette. As he clocked in, his manager caught a glimpse of him and stopped him, “Hey Tyler, we need you to set up the display for the Sony shipment we just got in. Mike never showed for his shift and we need it up by tomorrow morning”. He nodded and muttered “Checks out”, as he turned to walk into the storage room outback. A coworker not showing up? Setting up a display at five in the afternoon? What else would he expect from this place?
He may have disliked some of his coworkers and customers but all and all you couldn’5 beat being around what you love, ‘at least it made it more bearable than working at McDonald's’ he thought. He came back out of the storage room with the cart, he only needed a hand full of boxes to swap out what was already there but if he could make this take as long as possible he sure as hell was going to. As he took down the various models of MP3 Players off the shelf you remembered how poorly these sold, he knew they would. Even Sony had all but stopped production on the things. With the advent of streaming services and smartphones, those who didn’t care about having a physical medium switched over and those who did had never adapted to the new devices. Essentially leaving them in a sort of limbo state where only a handful of die-hard loyalists still owned, let alone, cared for the devices.
As he finished moving each box on and off the display he took one last look at the models he was placing on the shelves and considered how even though the older models had near-constant skipping, freezing, and noise problems, that there was still a bigger stigma among enthusiasts using these new sony models than the old ones. The only new examples he could think of which he hadn’t seen scrutinized would be the specialty brands which he remarked cost about triple what he had just been stocking. 
His shift was more or less what could be expected, he spent a few minutes although it felt like a few hours, explaining to a man that the store in fact could not refund him for the degrading of his tape as it was both, 15 years old, and also not from their store. He had to deal with these conversations a lot. Most music stores ran some sort of repair service or at least would offer to have your tapes shipped off for refurbishment. Allegedly the newer tapes weren’t victim to the same degree of magnetic decay as their old counterparts however most of them had only been released in the last 8 or so years so they had not yet entered the time frame that the older tapes began to show decay at.
After his shift finished Tyler grabbed his backpack and exited the mall into the now setting sun. Getting into his car and his hand made contact with the horn of his car as he realized he forgot to ask for more hours again.

## Micro Essay

Well there are many areas within the story that I think could be connected to a concept from our reading would be the scene in which Tyler begins to near the end of his shift and notes how almost all music stores would offer some sort of repair service even if it was something they couldn’t do in-house. Well, this scene was originally meant to illustrate one of the caveats that could have come about had Vinyl Records never been invented, it also illustrates the newness of old media, That new media remediates old media (Bolter and Grusin 1999) seems an intuitive way to understand this cultural situation in which notions of old and new at times become indistinct. New media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us. They are continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new users, context adaptation...” (Parikka, 2012). A good example of old media having never really left us is when Tyler notes how the new tapes are allegedly supposed to be more resistant to the type of decay that causes the older tapes to require repair even though they haven’t actually entered the time frame for this to be tested properly. This shows how despite the tapes in need of repair would be likely from around the 80s or 90s they are still be used alongside the tapes created in the last decade as well as in tech which was also made in the last fifteen or so years, creating a blurred line between what's considered an ‘old’ tape, beginning the question is it still old if it's been refurbished? I wrote this to draw a sort of parallel between how the same thing is done in our world however unlike in our world cassette tapes dominate the retro music scene and thus the needs and culture have changed with it.
